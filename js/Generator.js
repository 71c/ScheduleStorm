		// To get k-combinations of a set, we want to join each element
		// with all (k-1)-combinations of the other elements. The set of
		// these k-sized sets would be the desired result. However, as we
		// represent sets with lists, we need to take duplicates into
		// account. To avoid producing duplicates and also unnecessary
		// computing, we use the following approach: each element i
		// divides the list into three: the preceding elements, the
		// current element i, and the subsequent elements. For the first
		// element, the list of preceding elements is empty. For element i,
		// we compute the (k-1)-computations of the subsequent elements,
		// join each with the element i, and store the joined to the set of
		// computed k-combinations. We do not need to take the preceding
		// elements into account, because they have already been the i:th
		// element so they are already computed and stored. When the length
		// of the subsequent list drops below (k-1), we cannot find any
		// (k-1)-combs, hence the upper limit for the iteration:
		combs = [];

			// and store it to the set of k-combinations.
